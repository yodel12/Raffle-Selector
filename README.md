Raffle-Selector
===============

Uses ArrayLists to get lists of prizes and names from two files. 

From these two ArrayLists, a random person is chosen to get a random
prize. If a person is supposed to be chosen more than once, then their
name should appear in the "name" file more than once. 

Current problems include:
- Tab spacing
- prizes > names
